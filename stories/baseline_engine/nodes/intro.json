It is a technical demonstration of the `baseline_engine` capabilities. \n\nRight now, you are reading text defined in the `intro.json` file. The engine looks for this specific file to begin any story. \n\nEvery node in this tour includes a `help` command. Try it if you get stuck, or just to see how we handle global assistance.",
